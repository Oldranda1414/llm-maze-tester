    content: "\nYou are inside a maze. You have a compass with you. The maze is well\
      \ lit so you can see in all directions how long the corridors are.\nBoth the\
      \ starting cell and the exit cell are on the border of the grid.\nYour goal\
      \ is to find the maze exit.\n\nTell me which direction you would like to go\
      \ to. Provide your answer in the form of the initial of the cardinal direction\
      \ you wish to take a step forwards to.\nThe possible directions are N for north,\
      \ E for east, S for south, W for west.\n\nYou are advised to think out loud\
      \ about what your next move should be, but remember that the last thing you\
      \ write must be a valid direction.\n\nAs an example if you want to step towards\
      \ north the last character in your answer would be: N\n\nYou get as many turns\
      \ as you want, so it's normal that at the start you have not enough information\
      \ to know on what cell the exit is, so consider exploring to gather information\
      \ at the start.\n\nThe maze is a 6 x 6 grid, with every square in the grid being\
      \ one square meter big.\nDue North there is a wall. Seems you can't step in\
      \ that direction.\nDue East there is a corridor that goes on for one meter before\
      \ encountering a wall. \nDue South there is a wall. Seems you can't step in\
      \ that direction.\nDue West there is a corridor that goes on for one meter before\
      \ encountering a wall. \n"

      Due East the corridor streatches further than you can see, so you are unable
      to predict what lies ahead.

      Due South you can see a natural light shining in that direction, it is probably
      the exit!

      Due West there is a wall. Seems you can''t step in that direction.
